<h2>Basic Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Accept calls</li>
  <li>See phone alerts & send replies</li>
  <li>Get Fitbit notifications</li>
</ul>

<h2>Personalization</h2>
<p>The personalized dashboard helps us see our progress overtime, from steps to water intake, view recommendations, and receive reminders so that we can reach our goals. A cool customizable part of Fitbit is the way you can select your own interface. Whether you want a minimalistic or bright interface, Fitbit has them all!</p>

<h2>Third-Party Apps</h2>
<p>From cycling to listening to the radio, you can make your watch experience more personal by downloading popular apps from the Fitbit App Gallery to your watch. Examples include Peloton and Pandora!</p>

<h2>Music</h2>
<p>High paced music often boosts that needed motivation for working out. With a watch that stores music, you'll have that motivation. For extra confidence, use Ionic or Versa with Fitbit Flyer—wireless headphones.</p>

<h2>Fitbit Pay</h2>
<p>Water after a workout, bubble tea during the weekends, shopping at the mall. Wherever you are, Fitbit Pay™ allows you to make purchases right from your wrist! No phone or wallet needed. </p>

<h2> Abby's Experience </h2>
<body> With the Fitbit Versa, I have been able to customize the screen to my liking and use it to improve my daily life. As a student, I often get stressed with work, but my Fitbit reminds me when to workout, what I have next in my day, and what I need to get done by a certain time. One part that has improved my lifestyle is how the Fitbit helps track my water intake. Even with a hectic lifestyle, it's still important to reach the goal of 8 cups of water per day! Nevertheless, my favorite part of the Fitbit however is where it helps me reach my goals. I've set a lot of SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timely) goals for myself as I enter college, so the Fitbit has helped me stay productive and on track. I really enjoy the Fitbit and will continue to use it in the future, especially in college! I highly recommend this if you're looking for a convenient wearable that can track so many things, from sleep to workouts!
