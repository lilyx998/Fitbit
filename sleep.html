<h2><dt> Tracking</dt></h2>
  <p>
    Knowing how much you sleep can help you make better choices. If you wear your Fitbit tracker at night it'll automatically record your sleep, and then you can review your sleep duration and more in the Fitbit app.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you Want to make your mornings more peaceful, you can set a silent alarm in your Fitbit app and your tracker will wake you up with a quiet vibration.
  </p> 
  <p>
    Fitbit has one of the world’s largest sleep databases, which can help you learn more about your sleep stats and how your trends compare to those of the same age and gender. It also gives you relevant tips for improving your sleep quality and your nightly routine.
  </p>
  <p>
    Research shows that keeping a consistent bedtime and wake time leads to better sleep quality. The Fitbit app helps you stay on track by recommending a personalized sleep schedule based on your sleep goal, recent trends and your wake-up target. You can also get nice little bedtime reminders that notify you when it’s time to hit the hay.

<h2><dt> Stages</dt></h2>
  <i>See how well you sleep!</i> 
  <p>
    Every night, your body cycles through different sleep stages: light sleep, deep sleep and REM (rapid eye movement). Using the heart rate and sensitive motion detectors, your Fitbit can measure your time spent in each sleep stage and your time awake. This helps you to understand your sleep quality and learn whether you spent enough time in each sleep stage.

<h2> Our Experiences </h2>
<p> 
  As juniors in high school, our sleep schedules are pretty messed up. With the weight of schoolwork and extracurriculars weighing down on us, late nights are common, and school forces us to wake up early every morning. Fitbit offers us tips on improving our sleep schedule and night routines so that we can tuck in a little more sleeptime. We  love that Fitbit can wake us up with a nice, peaceful vibration instead of the harsh beeping of a normal alarm tone. It makes it easier to wake up every morning and helps us start our day off right!
