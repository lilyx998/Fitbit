      <h3>Lily Yang</h3>
      <p> Hi! I'm Lily, a student at Troy High School. I am a programming lead at my school's robotics team, where I teach and lead team members in programming our competitive FRC robot in Java. I'm also president of my school's Hack Club, where I create and teach workshop content to other students! Some of my other hobbies include painting and playing the flute. Computer science is one of my greatest passions, and I would love to help create amazing technologies that help the world!
      </p>
      <p>
        Last year, I participated in this competition in the beginner high school division, where I learned the basics of HTML and CSS to create a website about a world without technology. This year, I've learned so much more, and I'm really proud of our website's design and layout. Thank you MCWT for giving us this amazing opportunity! I had so much fun learning and creating this website.

      <p> Hi, I’m Abby, and I’m also a student at Troy High School. I'm super involved in STEM outreach and enjoy coding with my school’s coding club. Outside of that, I'm also on my school's color guard for the marching band. In the future, I plan to work within business and tech. 
      <br><br>
        This is my first year participating in the MCWT Web Design Contest for Girls, and I had lots of fun developing and designing this site! I loved discussing the ways technology affects our society and improves our lives. As a whole, I am super proud of what Lily and I have made together :)</p>
