Welcome! We created this website for the 2019 MCWT Web Design Competition in response to the prompt: “Develop a website for a tech product or service – imaginary or real – that impacts the world in a positive way.”

Our website includes: 

  - 5 pages, links, an embedded video

  - A focus on accessibility for all people and devices 
      - Dropdown menu allows for easy navigation for mobile users
      - A footer at the bottom of all pages with links to other pages (easy navigation at the top and bottom of all pages)
      - Elements set to scale based off of screen size 
      - Contrasting text colors for easy reading
      - Alt tags describe images featured in the website -- which can be read aloud to blind users on a screen reader 
      
  - Simple, clean, modern design 
      - Appealing and soothing aqua color scape 
      - Consistent design across all pages: fonts, borders, color blocks
      - ![colors](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34987475/125563075-e5cad5dc-ae14-4b78-bcdc-9b3945048da0.png)
